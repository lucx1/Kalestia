								<h1>Community Groups</h1>
								<p>
									There are Community Groups of learning and discussing about the language on WhatsApp and Telegram. Feel free to join and be part of us!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Note:</strong> As Telegram and WhatsApp are third party for us, using any of these services will require you to agree to their terms of uses <strong>(<a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram</a>)</strong>. In addition, please note that WhatsApp is heavily connected to your phone number. Since these are public groups, anyone with the link may retrieve access to your phone number by joining.

								<h1>Language Generator <strong>(PRE-ALPHA)</strong></h1>
								<p>
									This program will let you generate nearly infinite languages based on Kalestia though actually entirely different.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Note:</strong> As currently it is in <strong>PRE-ALPHA</strong> state, bugs as well as missing or not working features are to expect!
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="button" href='language_generator'>Language Generator</a></p>
								<h1>Use Telegram in Kalestia</h1>
								<p>
									You can use Telegram (Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Android X) in Kalestia without the need of any complicated installations, rooting or jailbreaking. Use the links below to get started or involved!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Note:</strong> Translations are not complete at this point in time and many strings might appear in English. We are continuosly working on the language pack.

								<h1>Kalestia translations for WhatsApp on iOS</h1>
								<p>
									You can download a translation file on your iPhone to show WhatsApp in Kalestia.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="button" href='Localizable.strings'>Download language file</a></p>
								</p>
								<h2>Important notes</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>The process requires your iPhone to be <strong>jailbroken</strong>. If you don't know what a jailbreak is, there is a 99% chance you are not jailbroken and it won't work.</li>
										<li>The translation file isn't by any means complete at this point in time which means that many strings will still show in English. Keep coming back to the site as the file will be updated frequently.</li>
										<li>The file was tested and works on WhatsApp version 2.19.92 on iOS version 12.4. Other versions may work but have not been tested.</li>
										<li>I am <strong>not responsible</strong> for any black screens, bootloops or dead phones. Editing system files can be <strong>dangerous</strong> so please be aware of what you are doing!</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h2>Instructions for setting up</h2>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>Again, please make sure your phone is jailbroken or else it won't work. There is no way you can do that without a jailbreak.</li>
										<li>If you haven't done so yet, download a file manager that can show system files (I recommend Filza).</li>
										<li>In your file explorer navigate to <code>/var/containers/Bundle/Application/9CB5B1D1-2B9C-4D5D-9C40-E0394A869379/WhatsApp.app/</code>, then into whichever language folder of which your system is set to. If your system is set to English, that folder would be <code>en.lproj</code>.</li>
										<li>Backup the original language file by renaming <code>Localizable.strings</code> to <code>Localizable.strings.bak</code>.</li>
										<li>Now move the downloaded language file to that same folder without renaming. It has to be called <code>Localizable.strings</code>.</li>
										<li>Kill WhatsApp from your app switcher and reopen it. You should be good to go!</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<h2>Instructions for restoring</h2>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>In your file explorer navigate to <code>/var/containers/Bundle/Application/9CB5B1D1-2B9C-4D5D-9C40-E0394A869379/WhatsApp.app/</code>, then into whichever language folder of which your system is set to. If your system is set to English, that folder would be <code>en.lproj</code>.</li>
										<li>Delete the custom language file <code>Localizable.strings</code>.</li>
										<li>Rename <code>Localizable.strings.bak</code> back to <code>Localizable.strings</code>.</li>
										<li>Kill WhatsApp from your app switcher and reopen it. You should be good to go!</li>
									</ol>
