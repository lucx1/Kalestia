## What is Kalestia?

Kalestia is a new language, created by our community and is still being developed. The vocabulary isn't anything near to completed, so if you like to speak that language and need words that aren't yet created, you can suggest your Kalestian translation and it will most probably be added to the language.

It is constructed on a completely gender neutral basis which makes it easy to learn without having to memorize genders of every word (like German, Russian, Romanic languages etc).

Maybe you might still be wondering, why the grammar looks so complex and complicated to learn, if you've had a look into our grammar file. This might be true in some way but Kalestia's grammar is fully build on top of rules for everything with hardly any exceptions for words (even "to be" uses normal conjugation). If you look more deeply into the grammar file, you might also find a general structure and you will see, that a tense, a case etc. always uses the same letter in the ending, regardless of where it appears.
But, if you have problems understanding the grammar, feel free to ask in our Telegram group, or me and I will explain you every part starting from the very simplest basics.
